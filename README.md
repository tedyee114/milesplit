# milesplit

This is a project fro IE3425, Engineering Databases, at Northeastern University.
The project is a Python file connected via Flask to HTML pages stored in a 'root/templates' folder
The Python file connects on the other end via commandline and SQLite3 to a database file, allowing queries to be passed from an HTML GUI that return rendered webpages displaying information from the database.
As GitHub pages only supports static HTML pages, they are only viewable here:      https://tedyee114.github.io/milesplit/templates/index
Thus, the main functions of the site only run locally
There would be more features, bug fixes, and formatting added with additional time, but this product was a proof-of concept on a deadline
